An opensource reimplementation of the LBA (Little Big Adventure) game engine.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h2>Current Progress</h2>

<h3>April 19, 2013</h3>

Prequengine was merged with TwinEngine and both are now a single project called twin-e. TwinEngine was the main engine created by yaz0r years ago.<br>
<br>
<br>
<h3>April 11, 2013</h3>

New windows version of the engine released. It fixes some important bugs left on the previous version and also adds missing script features. The TODO feature list is getting shorter.<br>
Don't forget to report issues you found. It will be a great help.<br>
<br>
Enjoy,<br>

<h3>December 30, 2012</h3>

After fixing an important script bug in the engine, I've decided to release early another engine version instead of waiting for the menu features.<br>
Hope you enjoy the game. Any issue you've encounter let me know through issues page.<br>

<h3>January 1, 2012</h3>

During the past couple of weeks a lot of improvements where made in the engine. One of the most important is the implementation of game voices. The others were little missing game features, together with important scripting fix that make the game even more playable.<br>
<br>
For the next release, I still want to make other features, specially the main menu. Its important for used to be able to create new games with their own name. So as soon as this is implemented, a new release will be made.<br>

<h3>December 17, 2011</h3>

During this week, I've started working on this project again with the goal to implement missing features and fix some of the known bugs. The current revision <a href='https://code.google.com/p/twin-e/source/detail?r=193'>r193</a> is more stable now and the player should be able to finish the game without problems.<br>
<br>
A new release will come in the next days/weeks. I will try to implement more features and fix some bugs, specially the sound related issues. As always, all help is welcome to identify bugs in the game.<br>

<h3>January 3, 2010</h3>

The project has boost its progress in the last weeks quite nice. The engine start to get its own life. Some of the most important features of the game were implemented and the game get a bit more interaction. This interactions is not yet completely playable, but not much is left for a first game experience with the minimum compatibility.<br>
<br>
I add a todo list under wiki pages the way we can track all the missing important parts of the game at this stage. I'll follow that list in the next developments.<br>
